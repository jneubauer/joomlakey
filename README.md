# Joomla! Keyboard Master

A plugin that allows Joomla administrators to use easy keyboard shortcuts to accomplish frequent tasks like saving an item (article, module, menu, etc), opening a new item, and other frequent tasks.

### Release Downloads

For downloadable releases, check the [Releases tab](https://github.com/jneubauer/joomlakey/releases). Probably safer than relying on what's currently in master.

### Setup

Install. That's it! :) Just enable the plugin, and you can start using your shortcuts right away!

### Available Shortcuts

Shortcut | Action
---  | --- 
Ctrl + s | Save open form
Ctrl + d | Save & Close open form
Ctrl + g | Save & New open form
Ctrl + k | Cancel open form
Ctrl + q | New article
Ctrl + n | New menu item
Ctrl + m | New module
Ctrl + j | Admin Control Panel
Ctrl + h | Help (coming soon)

### Why?

If you work with content or code all day, you most likely use a lot of keyboard shortcuts. I built this because I got frustrated of working in my IDE and pressing Cmd + s to quickly save a document, and then going into my Joomla sites and doing the same to save an article or module, only to get stuck with the browsers "save a file". This lets me keep a lot of the easy shortcuts that save a lot of time.

### Adding Shortcuts of Your Own

### Stuff In The Works

Help Screen - keyboard shortcut with a modal listing all available keyboard shortcuts

Customizable shortcuts? idk, need to figure out the most efficient way to do this, but this might be something that happens.
