Keyboard Master\r\n\r\nA plugin that allows Joomla administrators to use easy keyboard shortcuts to accomplish frequent tasks like saving an item (article, module, menu, etc), opening a new item, and other frequent tasks.\r\n\r\n### Release Downloads\r\n\r\nFor downloadable releases, check the [Releases tab](https://github.com/jneubauer/joomlakey/releases). Probably safer than relying on what's currently in master.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nInstall. That's it! :) Just enable the plugin, and you can start using your shortcuts right away!\r\n\r\n### Available Shortcuts\r\n\r\nShortcut | Action\r\n---  | --- \r\nCtrl + s | Save\r\nCtrl + d | Save & Close\r\nCtrl + g | Save & New\r\nCtrl + k | Cancel/Close\r\nCtrl + n | New\r\nCtrl + h | Admin Control Panel\r\nCtrl + ? | Help (coming soon)\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nIf you work with content or code all day, you most likely use a lot of keyboard shortcuts. I built this because I got frustrated of working in my IDE and pressing Cmd + s to quickly save a document, and then going into my Joomla sites and doing the same to save an article or module, only to get stuck with the browsers \"save a file\". This lets me keep a lot of the easy shortcuts that save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n### Adding Shortcuts of Your Own\r\n\r\n### Stuff In The Works\r\n\r\nHelp Screen - keyboard shortcut with a modal listing all available keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\nCustomizable shortcuts? idk, need to figure out the most efficient way to do this, but this might be something that happens.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nGNU General Public License version 3 or later.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[idk, tweet me @219jondn or something](http://twitter.com/219jondn \"Tweet at @219jondn\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
